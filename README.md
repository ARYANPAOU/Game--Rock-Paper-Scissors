# Game--Rock-Paper-Scissors
A fun and interactive Rock Paper Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project lets players go head-to-head against the computer by choosing rock, paper, or scissors. The game immediately determines the winner based on the classic rules and updates the interface dynamically.

The UI is enhanced with smooth styling and subtle details—like a cursor change on hover—to improve user experience. The game also includes console logging, allowing users to open the browser's developer console and observe real-time updates, such as player choices, computer choices, and the result of each round.

Perfect for those learning front-end fundamentals, DOM manipulation, and basic game logic in JavaScript.
